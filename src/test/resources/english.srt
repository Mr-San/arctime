1
00:00:00,175 --> 00:00:03,150
Okay, And now, since 1981,

2
00:00:03,175 --> 00:00:04,950
 there has been a lot of progress 

3
00:00:05,075 --> 00:00:10,475
in designing quantum algorithms and thinking about implementation

4
00:00:10,525 --> 00:00:16,700
so that there's a lot of work on how to utilize quantum power. 

5
00:00:16,775 --> 00:00:18,300
And for example, 

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:26,150
I want to specifically mention a particularly famous and striking example

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:31,675
namely that we know that in modern cryptography, 

8
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:38,275
there are many crypto systems to protect secrets. 

9
00:00:38,475 --> 00:00:44,750
They would use something related to factoring of large integers.

10
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:52,025
And now if I give you, say, a 400-bit ... a 400-digit integer, 

11
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,825
it turns out to be extremely difficult to factor it. 

12
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:01,675
So we all know that multiplication is easy. 

13
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:05,950
If you multiply two 200-digit numbers, 

14
00:01:06,475 --> 00:01:08,325
I think that you can do it very fast,

15
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,200
and certainly with a computer, you can do it really fast. 

16
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,775
But if I give you a 400-bit ... digit number,

17
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:22,050
and ask you where are the two factors, and you will have difficulty doing it. 

18
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:28,150
And now this problem turns out to have a quantum algorithm, 

19
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,150
proposed by Peter Shor in 1994.

20
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,400
And it's been proved 

21
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,725
that a quantum computer will be able to factor it much faster. 

22
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:43,200
So there are many ways to estimate 

23
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,900
what the running times are of the quantum computer.

24
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,275
and so one estimate saying that 

25
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,175
if you today want to factor at 400-digit number on the supercomputer, 

26
00:01:54,225 --> 00:01:56,425
it would take 600,000 years.

27
00:01:56,425 --> 00:02:00,025
but if you do it on a quantum computer,

28
00:02:00,025 --> 00:02:05,325
and when a suitably sized quantum computer is available, 

29
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:10,150
ok, then you can do it in a few hours, and possibly minutes. 

30
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,700
So Peter Shor's algorithm, 

31
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:19,975
it's probably the most famous quantum algorithm. 

32
00:02:20,075 --> 00:02:29,225
But that's not the only quantum algorithm that is actually important.

33
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:34,400
I mean, the factoring is great for crypto-code breaking,

34
00:02:34,475 --> 00:02:37,525
 but there are other things actually related to.

35
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:40,550
one of the questions from Feynman.

36
00:02:40,675 --> 00:02:45,175
 If you have quantum computers, can you simulate quantum systems? 

37
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,525
And it turns out for by now, 

38
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,050
there are large classes of problems people have proved,

39
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:58,075
 that it's possible to simulate many quantum physical systems with the quantum computer. 

40
00:02:58,175 --> 00:03:01,525
And now, in particular,

41
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:07,100
if you really have very powerful quantum computers to simulate physical systems, 

42
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,100
you would be able to make progress on problems 

43
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:18,100
such as the design of new materials, or the design of drugs, and so on. 

44
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:21,700
And so it would have enormous potential impact. 

45
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:28,525
And there are things that are actually pretty classical type of nonlinear optimization, 

46
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:35,300
and also there are things related to problems in machine learning, and AI, 

47
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:41,175
Quantum computing is in addition very useful in related fields, 

48
00:03:41,175 --> 00:03:48,025
like in quantum communication and quantum cryptography.

49
00:03:48,075 --> 00:03:53,775
I think it's a subject that the QCrypt conference is devoted to.

50
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:58,975
 So this would relate to things like unbreakable codes

51
00:03:58,975 --> 00:04:07,300
and many other cryptographic operations using quantum operations. 

52
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:13,750
And now, I think that it's fit to point out 

53
00:04:13,825 --> 00:04:22,150
that we have some of the originators of the field and also great system builders here. 

54
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,650
Ah, I think that the famous work by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard 

55
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:35,850
is really the kind of the people who pioneered the whole field. 

56
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:39,825
And professor Jian-Wei Pan is a person 

57
00:04:39,925 --> 00:04:49,075
who is really one of the leading experimental system builders in this area.

58
00:04:49,075 --> 00:04:51,375
 I think including the Micius satellite.

59
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,575
I think this is among the great achievements.

60
00:04:56,325 --> 00:05:00,600
And now, as I mentioned the very beginning 

61
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,050
the "how" and "why" of quantum computer 

62
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,075
remain mysterious to outsiders.

63
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,925
And so now we're going to the heart of the matter.

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,100
 Let's see that how quantum power can be used to speed things up. 

65
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:25,900
And actually, we are going to look at this famous quantum algorithm

66
00:05:25,975 --> 00:05:30,325
for doing a factoring by Peter Shor. 

67
00:05:31,175 --> 00:05:34,475
Peter Shor's algorithm is very mathematical, 

68
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,525
so I'm going to present it in a different way. 

69
00:05:37,575 --> 00:05:43,025
And so, kind of hide all the mathematics, 

70
00:05:43,025 --> 00:05:46,825
But doing things in a more conceptual way.

71
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,000
So I'm going to do it in two steps.

72
00:05:51,075 --> 00:05:52,450
In the first step, 

73
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:59,775
I'm going to describe an alternative classical algorithms 

74
00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:06,625
to the standard factoring algorithms that a number of theorists are doing

75
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:12,025
So we're going to design a classical algorithm to solve this problem. 

76
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:17,925
And unfortunately, this classical algorithm would also run in exponential time

77
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:24,700
However, this algorithm is going to have the advantage 

78
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,450
where if you look at it and if you think about the essence of quantum mechanics, 

79
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,600
you'll be able to simulate it with a quantum computer, 

80
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,075
with the exponential speedup. 

81
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,225
And so therefore, we're going to do a two-step thing. 

82
00:06:45,225 --> 00:06:48,750
First, we're going to design a classical algorithm, 

83
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:54,750
and the second part is that we're going to show the quantum power is enough 

84
00:06:54,925 --> 00:07:00,775
to simulate how this classical algorithms is used

85
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:10,750
And the wave-particle duality is going to come in at the second stage. 

86
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,725
And now, actually, this classical algorithm itself is really interesting 

87
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,775
because it has some famous forerunner 

88
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,350
because it's really the descendant of some very famous work in physics. 

89
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:33,700
And this branch of physics or chemistry, is called x-ray crystallography. 

90
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,575
Okay,it's using x-rays to take pictures 

91
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:45,525
like you know, that we take chest x-ray pictures to see whether there is any disease. 

92
00:07:45,525 --> 00:07:48,500
Or when you hurt your leg, 

93
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:53,250
you take x-ray pictures to see whether the bones are intact or not. 

94
00:07:53,300 --> 00:08:02,400
Okay now, this very famous line of work starting in 1895 with Roentgen,

95
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:11,600
 who accidentally discovered a mysterious phenomenon which he termed x-rays. 

96
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:16,050
Okay,and it's a novel thing. 

97
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:20,800
People had difficulty determining whether it's a particle or a wave. 

98
00:08:20,925 --> 00:08:27,100
And, but in any case Roentgen got recognized by his work in discovering the x-ray.

99
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:36,525
And he actually was the first Nobel Prize winner in 1901 of the physics prize

100
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:43,600
And now in 1912, von Laue solved the problem, resolved the problem, 

101
00:08:43,675 --> 00:08:46,275
whether an x-ray is a particle or a wave. 

102
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:52,325
And Von Laue, he had this great idea

103
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,775
 by shining the x-ray through crystals like salt and so on.

104
00:08:57,925 --> 00:09:00,925
And he managed to get a diffraction pattern. 

105
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:03,450
And I think according to the standard of the time, 

106
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,300
if you can get diffraction pattern, then it has to be wave

107
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,250
because particles, they don't interfere with each other. 

108
00:09:11,275 --> 00:09:13,750
Now that's not the end of the story 

109
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,700
I think it's fine for von Laue to receive a Nobel prize for his work,

110
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,725
but there are better things to come. 

111
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:27,750
In 1913, the Braggs, father and son team, 

112
00:09:27,825 --> 00:09:32,450
they derived a mathematical formula for the diffraction pattern.

113
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:36,350
To see that, well, how do you explain the diffraction pattern

114
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:41,200
Well, the mathematics using optics, then you can do it

115
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:48,575
And, this has a very big implication.

116
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,275
Once you have the ability to use mathematics to analyze and make predictions, 

117
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,025
then you can use it in research

118
00:09:58,075 --> 00:10:01,875
I mean suppose you have a crystal of unknown structure, 

119
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,250
and you take some x-ray pictures, 

120
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,850
maybe many of them from different angles and so on.

121
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:10,400
Now, you look at the mathematics,

122
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:19,375
sometimes you will be able to recover what the crystal structure must be like. 

123
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,275
That's a great thought.

124
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:29,275
that you look at -- you take a photo of something, 

125
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:35,000
and you come back to figure out what's the secret of the crystals. 

126
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:38,375
And this is immensely successful, 

127
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:46,450
and it used many, many Nobel prizes in the next fifty years 

128
00:10:46,575 --> 00:10:52,450
 And, actually, they get more and more ambitious. 

129
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:57,350
You can,Initially, because the math formula is pretty messy, 

130
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,675
so you can only analyze very simple things,

131
00:10:59,675 --> 00:11:03,850
like in inorganic material molecules

132
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:12,150
but later on, even very large molecules of importance to biology,

133
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:15,825
people found ways of analyzing them 

134
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:22,175
and determining the structure of these proteins and these structures.

135
00:11:23,075 --> 00:11:29,800
So very complicated things you can do, by this simple idea 

136
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,950
And so now let's summarize what we have done so far  

137
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,650
What we have discovered is 

138
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,675
that if you use the x-rays, I mean this is light wave.

139
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,200
If you use it and you take pictures, you can recover. 

140
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,300
Or in our computer science mind, 

141
00:11:46,325 --> 00:11:52,250
you can compute a function of the object some secret of the object. 

142
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:56,825
So now the question, this would be an intellectual leap

143
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:01,225
in saying that if I look at an integer, 

144
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:07,075
is there a way for me to take an x-ray picture of the integer?

145
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,925
 Of course, if you write the bits, you put an x-ray through it. 

146
00:12:10,925 --> 00:12:15,200
I think you would just get exactly back what you start with.

147
00:12:15,425 --> 00:12:23,200
So, you have to build a crystal somehow, based upon this integer. 

148
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,450
And then you take x-ray threw it. 

149
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,050
And perhaps you will be able to do it. 

150
00:12:31,075 --> 00:12:34,100
So the answer is yes, 

151
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:37,825
the kind of the first stage is to design this classical algorithm.

152
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:42,025
And now we are designing really an optical algorithm.

153
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:48,425
But, since it's classical physics, if it's classical physics,

154
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:51,800
I can simulate it with the classical computer. 

155
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:55,650
So it will be a classical algorithm. Okay.

156
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:03,575
So, let's just imagine that we're taking this x-ray photo of the integer n

157
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:09,150
and first we -- there is some way ...  you have to do it smartly, in order to grow a crystal. 

158
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:16,025
And then you have this x-ray on it. And look at the diffraction pattern,

159
00:13:16,075 --> 00:13:20,500
maybe you have to do it several times. 

160
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,875
And you figure out, you examine the photo and you figure out what this factor is. 

161
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,825
This can actually be done. 

162
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,575
There's kind of messy mathematics in it, but this actually can be done.

163
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:39,100
 And so this is basically the pictorial way of seeing it. 

164
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,550
You have this integer. 

165
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,350
You kind of do an optical experiment.  

166
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,200
You look at the pattern and you see what it is.

167
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:52,525
And now the problem is that the crystal is of enormous size. 

168
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:57,375
So essentially, if you do the naïve thing, build this crystal, 

169
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:08,675
I think the whole galaxy, and maybe the whole universe, will not be enough to support this experiment. 

170
00:14:09,675 --> 00:14:19,175
And now come to the next stage. So now here's the critical observation

171
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:24,350
The first one is that we don't need the whole photo.

172
00:14:24,775 --> 00:14:26,975
Because classically, you take an x-ray, 

173
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:32,950
the doctor will see the whole negative, and then look at it, but we don't need that. 

174
00:14:32,975 --> 00:14:36,575
Actually, we only need a few sample points. 

175
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,400
So we don't need exponential number of samples.

176
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,875
We only need a polynomial number of samples. 

177
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,725
So that's progress.

178
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,850
Now, how do you take samples? 

179
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,575
Even taking one sample, It's sort of difficult,

180
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:57,575
because if you look at taking one sample, 

181
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:03,700
the calculation you do, it's the sum over an exponential number of terms. 

182
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:08,125
So if you use the classical algorithm to do it, it's still hard. 

183
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:13,250
But that exponential sum is very structured. 

184
00:15:13,525 --> 00:15:19,375
So that if you use a clever way to do the [computation]

185
00:15:19,425 --> 00:15:21,325
 if you have a quantum computer, 

186
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,100
you can do something called the quantum Fourier transform. 

187
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,775
 if you have quantum computer, you can do the trick of the monkey king. 

188
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,250
So that you can do the kind of parallel search, 

189
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:38,200
and do it with an exponential amount of saving in terms of time. 

190
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,850
Ok, now, what does it mean to take one sample?

191
00:15:41,925 --> 00:15:44,500
 And now here comes the punch line, 

192
00:15:44,525 --> 00:15:48,825
where the wave-particle duality comes in. 

193
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:55,575
Taking one sample means that, usually when I take an x-ray picture, 

194
00:15:55,575 --> 00:16:00,225
there are many x-ray photons are going through your body and so on. 

195
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:04,200
But suppose you make a light to be dimmer and dimmer

196
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:12,050
 until eventually there's only one photon at a time that can go through the apparatus.

197
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:18,875
And now the wave-particle duality is saying

198
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:22,850
that even though it's just one photon, one particle going through it,

199
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:30,975
that actually, the probability distribution will be identical to the classical one. 

200
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:35,425
So that you are going to have exactly the same distribution,

201
00:16:35,475 --> 00:16:37,150
so if I can sample, 

202
00:16:37,325 --> 00:16:44,025
just do it for one photon, and detect where the photon lands. 

203
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:51,025
And you see that the critical point is that when it's a particle. 

204
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:58,600
And then you can talk about I want to detect where the photon will land. 

205
00:16:58,675 --> 00:17:02,236
When you measure them, they can only land in one place. 

206
00:17:02,236 --> 00:17:06,125
So you get a very definitive sample point of the whole thing. 

207
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:13,853
So, the net result is that you combine these together, 

208
00:17:13,925 --> 00:17:21,775
you get a quantum algorithm, of a kind of polynomial running time.

209
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:31,575
I think that's the kind of summary of the main part that the main point I want to make that

210
00:17:31,575 --> 00:17:34,575
where does the quantum power come from? 

211
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:39,600
It's no more mysterious than the mystery of quantum physics.
